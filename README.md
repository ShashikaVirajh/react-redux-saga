## Motivation

- This project was developed as a reference project to start working with redux-saga library.
- Tried to provide a complete but simple example for the developers who want to easily get used to this
  amazing library.
- Created redux utils to minimize the repetitive code while working with redux and sagas.

## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikaVirajh/react-redux-saga-example.git
cd react-redux-saga-example

NOTE: If the APIs are not working, please add this chrome pluging.
CORS Unblock (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)

Sometimes these APIs are not working. It must be due to the free plan of cocktaildb. Make sure to remove this plugging once the testing is done.

## Tech Stack Used

Typescript - for type safety
